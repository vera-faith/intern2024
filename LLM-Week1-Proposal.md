# Proposal for LLM Intern Summer Project: "Jazz Bazz AI"

## Jazz AI
An AI-Driven Sheet Music Generator and Practice Aid
* Main focus for project is directed towards Bass Guitar, but I would like to be able to expand it to all other instruments in the future. 

## Project Overview
The Jazz Assistant project aims to develop an AI-powered application that generates sheet music for musicians. This project will not only generate sheet music but also include features to aid in practice and improvisation.

## Project Objectives
1. **Sheet Music Generation:** Create an AI model capable of generating sheet music for bass guitar from user-selected jazz standards.

2. **Interactive Practice Aid:** Develop interactive features that assist with practice sessions, such as tempo adjustments, playback options, and real-time feedback.

3. **Improvisation Support:** Implement tools to help users practice improvisation over jazz progressions.

4. **User-Friendly Interface:** Design an intuitive interface suitable for high school students, with emphasis on ease of use and engagement.


## Target Audience
High school students who play bass guitar, especially those involved in jazz bands or interested in jazz music.

## Project Components

### 1. Data Collection
* Gather a dataset of jazz standards and corresponding bass lines.

* Collect MIDI files and sheet music to train the AI model.


### 2. Model Development
- Use an existing language model (such as GPT) and fine-tune it on the collected dataset to generate sheet music.

- Implement a music notation library to convert the generated output into readable sheet music.


### 3. Practice Aid Features
- **Tempo Control:** Allow users to adjust the tempo of generated music.

- **Playback Options:** Provide playback functionality with options to solo or mute different parts.

- **Real-Time Feedback:** Use audio recognition to give real-time feedback on the user's playing accuracy.


### 4. Improvisation Tools
- Include a feature to generate chord progressions for improvisation practice.

- Provide scales and arpeggios that fit the generated progressions.


### 5. User Interface Design
- Develop a web or mobile application with a clean, intuitive interface.

- Ensure the app includes tutorials and guides to help users get started.


## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Music21 (for music theory and notation)

- **Frontend:** Flutter (for cross-platform mobile app), or React (for web app)

- **Tools:** Docker, Kubernetes (for scalable deployment), Firebase (for authentication and database)


## Expected Outcomes

- A functional prototype of the JazzBass Assistant application.

- A repository of generated sheet music for popular jazz standards.

- Positive feedback from beta testers (e.g., music students, jazz band members).


## Mentorship and Support

- Regular check-ins with project mentors.

- Access to resources and workshops on AI and music technology.

- Collaboration with fellow interns and developers.


## Conclusion

The JazzBass Assistant project provides an exciting opportunity for a young high school jazz musician to combine their passion for music with cutting-edge AI technology. By the end of the summer, the intern will have gained valuable experience in AI development, software engineering, and user interface design, while creating a tool that can benefit the jazz music community.
